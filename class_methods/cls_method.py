Class Method vs Static Method

The basic difference between the class method vs Static method in Python and when to use the class method and static method in Python.

1. A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
2. A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
3. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. 
On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.

4. We use @classmethod decorator in Python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in Python.
